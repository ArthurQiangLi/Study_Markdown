Creating a directory or file structure display in Markdown is possible by writing out the structure with indentation. However, there are a few tricks and tools to streamline this process, especially in VSCode:

### 1. **Manually Formatting in Markdown**

- To represent a directory, you can use indentation with bullets or symbols like this:

  ```md
  - **project-root/**
    - **src/**
      - main.js
      - utils.js
    - **assets/**
      - logo.png
      - style.css
    - **README.md**
  ```

- Bold the directories for clarity or use icons (like ðŸ“‚ for folders and ðŸ“„ for files) for a more visual effect:

  ```md
  - ðŸ“‚ **project-root**
    - ðŸ“‚ src
      - ðŸ“„ main.js
      - ðŸ“„ utils.js
    - ðŸ“‚ assets
      - ðŸ“„ logo.png
      - ðŸ“„ style.css
    - ðŸ“„ README.md
  ```

### 2. **Using an Extension for Directory Tree**

- Install **Markdown Tree** or **Markdown File Tree Generator** in VSCode:
  - Search for the extension in the Extensions panel.
  - Once installed, use the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) to open the command (`Markdown Tree: Insert Directory Tree`).
  - It will generate a file tree in your Markdown file based on the directory structure of your project.

### 3. **Automatically Create TOC-Style Structure**

- For a more detailed file structure outline, use **Markdown All in One** to generate a table of contents for headings representing each file or section.
